PHP Aspect framework(PAF)
This framework+module allows you to use Aspects in PHP classes/functions.
It uses modified PHP intercept module(I got it here: http://pecl.php.net/package/intercept) with added functionality.
New module may be downloaded from "intercept_extension" directory.
Example of the framework usage may be found in "framework/example.php".
